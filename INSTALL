INSTALLATION VIA COMPILATION 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is currently only one officially-supported approach for building
and installing ROME from the open-source code:2

Make sure that you have installed Intel C++ complier, Intel mkl library 
and Intel MPI library. To install ROME, the first step is loading your 
intel complier, for example:

source /apps/mpss/intel_parallel_2015/composer_xe_2015.1.133/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
source /apps/mpss/intel_parallel_2015/impi/5.0.2.044/bin64/mpivars.sh

To build ROME, unzip rome1.1.2.zip and go into folder first:

unzip rome1.1.2.zip
cd rome1.1.2

or building ROME with “mpiicpc” complier, using:

make

If you bind your Intel C++ complier with other MPI implementation like “mpicxx”, using:

export ROME_CC=mpicxx
make

If you want to build ROME with Non-MPI (single node), using:

export ROME_CC=icpc
make

If you want to compile ROME with the OFFLOAD mode for Intel Knight Corner coprocessors:

export ROME_OFFLOAD=true
export ROME_CC=mpiicpc
make

The binary file will be generated in floder “/bin”.

Type:
./bin/rome_deep2d -help
to retrieve usage information.

Notice:if you want to rebuild the code,you need to clean first
make clean

Good luck!
