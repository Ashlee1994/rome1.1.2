ROME 1.1.0 (March 29, 2017):

Unsupervised deep 2D classification is introduced. It implementes:
1) Adaptive MAP-based image alignment and classification;
2) SML based on GTM adapted to Fourier space;
3) Deep2D protocol that combines MAP alignment with SML classification.

The SML/Deep2D principle and method are documented in:
J. Wu, Y. Ma, C. Condgon, B. Brett, S. Chen, Q. Ouyang, Y. Mao. 
Unsupervised single-particle deep classification via statistical manifold 
learning. arXiv:1604.04539 [physics.data-an] (2016).

The adaptive MAP method was documented in:
Sigworth, F.J. A maximum-likelihood approach to single-particle image 
refinement. J Struct Biol 122, 328-339 (1998).
Scheres, S.H. Maximum-likelihood Multi-reference Refinement for Electron 
Microscopy Images. J Mol Biol 348, 139-149 (2005).

algorithm with GPU implementation for electron cryomicroscopy.
